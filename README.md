# NLP-Projects

I created an #NLP project uses advanced machine learning algorithms (BERT) to classify sentences as toxic or non-toxic, allowing for a safer online experience by identifying and filtering out negative and harmful content using #streamlit

Web app: https://toxic-statements-class.streamlit.app/


The project also promotes positivity by highlighting non-toxic sentences that can be applied in social media, forums, and customer service to improve the online environment, but not in this version of the project. Join the fight against toxicity by giving my NLP project a try today.


Try putting a sentence together and see what happens. It's not perfect, but it's a great achievement!
